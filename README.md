## The game

You are about to witness the majesty of **git-gud dun-die**.  You will pilot a very Millennium Falcon-like spacecraft to its inevitable doom.  Avoid the larger, Start Destroyer-like, space crafts or be destroyed.  Enjoy the atmospheric music, augmenting difficulty and hypnotic background.

## Controls

Move using your arrows, or the typical 'wasd'.  Hit the space bar to activate your laser cannon, but be warned, as with many things on the old beater of a ship, somethings may not function as expected (although somehow sound will still carry through space (we don't judge here)).

## Winning

Your sense of personal achievement shall be the measure of your failure or victory.  Following the style of older arcade games, there is no outright win condition.  However, several different game over texts exist based on your performance.  This may contain offensive language to many.  Offense is not intended.
